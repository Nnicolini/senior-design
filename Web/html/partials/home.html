Kaboom is an online platform that allows users to perform basic banking transactions, such as viewing an account balance, transferring funds, and viewing account history. The system involves a web application that communicates with a transaction processing environment that sits in the cloud. The backend is highly scalable and has been put under high stress testing using multi-threaded simulation. Security features are also implemented that will help prevent fraudulent activity and scamming the system.
